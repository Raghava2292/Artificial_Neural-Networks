Task - 1

    Application of Artificial Neural Networks to build a classification model that can predict a forest fire category based on the other conditions

Task - 2

    Application of Artificial Neural Networks to build a classification model that can predict if a persons salary is above or below 50K based on other conditions.
    

I performed the hyperparameter tuning for both the tasks to find the best set of hyperparameters.
